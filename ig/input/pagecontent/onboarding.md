### Overview

2. Fill out the [ReportStream onboarding form](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/elr-checklist).

### Contacting Us

We'd love to chat to get a feel for what you are looking to get out of the ReportStream Intermediary.  Drop [us](mailto:cdc-ti@flexion.us) a line.

### ReportStream Form

After contacting us, and we are all on the same page, we'll request you fill out the [ReportStream onboarding form](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/resources/elr-checklist).
The Interediary uses the larger [ReportStream](https://reportstream.cdc.gov) ecosystem to receive and send messages.
That means that you'll be onboarded to ReportStream as part of this process.
