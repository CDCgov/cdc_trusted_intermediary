### Overview

We support ETOR ([Electronic Test Orders and Results](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/public-health-laboratory-etor.html)) for NBS ([Newborn Screening](https://www.cdc.gov/newbornscreening/)).
This testing is also known as Phenylketonuria (PKU) testing in many jurisdictions.

### Communication Flow

#### Orders

Orders request flow from a healthcare organization (HCO), such as a hospital or birthing center, to a public health lab.
The order contains demographic information on the baby and their next-of-kin, the formal request of the newborn screening panel, and any observations required to evaluate the specimen such as birth weight.
