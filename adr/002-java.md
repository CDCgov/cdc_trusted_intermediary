# 2. Java

Date: 2022-10-21

## Decision

We will use Java 17 for the main trusted intermediary code.
This doesn't preclude us from using other languages for other services or applications.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

We decided to use a JVM based language it because it has many third-party healthcare libraries and frameworks.

We decided on Java over Kotlin, Scala, and Groovy because more people know Java.
