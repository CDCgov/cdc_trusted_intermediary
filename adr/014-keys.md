# 14. Keys

Date: 2023-10-11

## Decision

We need to formalize and standardize how we are handling both our public and private keys, as well as naming conventions

## Status

Pending.

## Context

We currently have our keys listed in keybase inside of a team specific folder. We do not currently have any organization to this team-specific folder. The names of the keys in the folder do not match the name of the secrets in the Azure dev and staging environments.  We will need to agree to a unified and easy to understand naming standard that should include who the key is for, whether it's an org key, and the environment that the key is for.
