# ReportStream Scripts

The scripts in this folders are meant to be copied and run in the [prime-reportstream](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-reportstream) codebase inside the `prime-router` folder. You can also create symbolic link instead of copying the files in order to keep them up-to-date.

These scripts rely in a `CDCTI_HOME` environment variable that needs to be set in your environment to your local path to the CDC-TI codebase. You may update and run the `start-here.sh` script to set it. You may also want to add it to your shell's startup file to persist it.
